#Contributing to the Repo

Hi there, thank you for thinking of contributing. There are no formal set of guidelines, after all this is a very small and lightweight project.

Just make sure you clearly explain, either via GitHub comment or commit:
- Why you've made the changes
- How it improves and affects the code
- Some kind of documentation if it's a new feature.

If your PR is successful, you'll be added to the Authors list. Thanks :smile:
